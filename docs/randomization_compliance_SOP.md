# Randomization & Compliance SOP (One‑Pager)

**Purpose:** Standardize fair allocation and ensure uptake is measured transparently.

## Roles
- **Trial Lead:** locks strata & seed; runs randomization; maintains allocation file.
- **Data Manager:** prepares pairing dataset; validates strata; stores audit trail.
- **District Liaison:** communicates assignments; collects preference data pre‑randomization.

## Pre‑Randomization Intake (T‑14 to T‑7 days)
1. Confirm school eligibility and principal **preference** (want / neutral / prefer not).
2. Build strata: district × school level × size × preference.
3. Pair‑match within district where possible; otherwise block on strata only.

## Randomization (T‑5 to T‑3 days)
1. Freeze strata; generate **immutable seed**; log timestamp.
2. Randomize 1:1 **within strata** for **Phase A** (parallel CRT). Export allocation table.
3. Pre‑randomize **Phase B** wave order among remaining controls (balanced by strata).
4. Store allocation + seed in read‑only location; generate CONSORT flow skeleton.

## Allocation Concealment & Notification (T‑2 to T‑0)
- Conceal until assignments sent by Liaison with onboarding details for treatment schools.
- Controls informed of wave timing (do not receive product access yet).

## Compliance Definitions (school‑level)
- **Usage threshold:** ≥ *X* Eval‑generated/edited evaluations per month AND evidence citation rate ≥ *Y%*.
- **Training:** ≥1 live onboarding + completion of core modules.
- **Fidelity KPIs:** note→eval conversion rate, time‑to‑final, feature adoption (%).

## Monitoring & Reporting
- Weekly dashboard to Trial Lead; flag noncompliance for supportive outreach (no coercion).
- **Primary analysis:** ITT (all randomized schools). **Secondary:** CACE/TOT via IV.
- Archive: allocation table, seed, logs, protocol version, communication templates.

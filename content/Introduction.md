Teacher evaluation in K-12 education has historically suffered from two major issues: limited effectiveness in improving teaching and high burdens on school leaders. Despite waves of reform in the last decade, most teachers continue to receive uniformly positive ratings, with very few ever labeled below proficient

. Principals often acknowledge more teachers with weaknesses than they actually rate as such, due in part to cultural and logistical pressures (e.g. avoiding demoralization or lengthy HR processes)

. This persistent inflation of ratings and lack of candid feedback is known as the “Widget Effect,” a term from a 2009 TNTP study highlighting that evaluation systems often fail to distinguish or address differences in teacher effectiveness

. Consequently, many teachers do not find the evaluation process helpful – in one survey, 75% of teachers reported that their evaluation had no impact on their classroom practice, indicating that current evaluation systems “do not recognize good teaching, leave poor teaching unaddressed, and do not inform decision making in any meaningful way”

. Likewise, experts note that traditional evaluation approaches “rarely help teachers improve” instructional practice or clearly identify who is struggling versus succeeding

. In short, teacher-evaluation as implemented in many schools today often yields low-signal feedback that is not driving professional growth.

At the same time, the process of conducting evaluations is extremely time-intensive for principals and other administrators. With expanded requirements for multiple observations, rubric scoring, and conferences, principals are reportedly spending hundreds of hours per year on evaluations. For example, a study in Michigan found the median principal devoted about 248 hours (31 full work days) per year to teacher evaluation tasks

. Principals in other districts similarly report that each formal observation cycle (pre-conference, observation, scoring, and post-conference) can take 4–6 hours of work per teacher

. Given a principal might oversee dozens of teachers, it becomes **“the biggest challenge we still have in teacher evaluations – time”】

. Every hour spent writing up reports is an hour not spent in classrooms mentoring teachers or engaging with students and parents. This heavy workload can force trade-offs: in one district, administrators said the time spent observing and documenting was so onerous it prevented them from providing meaningful post-observation feedback to teachers

. Thus, there is a critical need for solutions that streamline the teacher evaluation process – reducing administrative burden while improving the quality of feedback delivered to teachers.

Eval by SwiftScore is an attempt to address these dual challenges by leveraging modern AI technology in the service of school leadership. Branded as an “AI Instructional Assistant,” Eval by SwiftScore is a software platform that helps principals streamline teacher evaluations with AI-powered support

. Principals can record or upload classroom observation notes (or even audio/video), and the system will rapidly generate rubric-aligned scores, evidence-based feedback comments, and personalized coaching plans for the observed teacher

. In essence, the tool acts like a virtual assistant, analyzing the observation data and producing a first draft of the evaluation documentation – including pinpointing specific evidence for each rubric component and suggesting actionable next steps for teacher development. By automating these laborious write-ups, Eval aims to dramatically cut down documentation time (the company claims up to 70% less time spent on evaluations and 80% less time creating coaching plans, enabling principals to double the number of coaching plans delivered

). At the same time, the AI is tuned to provide “shockingly precise feedback” with concrete examples, ostensibly more in-depth and objective than a rushed human write-up

. The platform also aggregates data into dashboards to help track teacher growth across a school, and includes features like a “Retention Risk Index” to flag teachers who might be at risk of leaving, based on satisfaction and feedback metrics.

In theory, such a tool could transform the teacher evaluation landscape: principals would reclaim time to spend on direct instructional leadership (e.g. more frequent classroom visits and coaching conversations), while teachers would receive richer feedback and more consistent evaluations. Ultimately, this should translate into accelerated teacher growth – i.e. improvements in teachers’ instructional skills and classroom practice – as well as higher teacher morale (since feedback is more actionable and fair) and possibly better teacher retention. However, these outcomes are far from guaranteed and need to be empirically tested. Education technology interventions have sometimes over-promised but under-delivered in real classrooms. The effectiveness of Eval by SwiftScore will depend on factors such as principal buy-in, proper training, actual usage patterns, and the tool’s capability to generate truly useful feedback across diverse classrooms and teaching styles.

This study is designed to rigorously evaluate the impact of Eval by SwiftScore in a real-world school setting. We are undertaking a multi-district field trial using a randomized controlled design to isolate the effects of giving schools access to the Eval tool. Over an 18-month period, we will compare schools using Eval against schools conducting “business-as-usual” evaluations, measuring differences in key outcomes like teacher observation ratings (growth), survey measures of teacher and principal satisfaction, and objective time logs of principal workload. By the end of the trial, we aim to answer whether this AI-assisted evaluation process truly leads to better teaching and a better evaluation experience. The study’s pragmatic hybrid design also allows us to observe implementation in context – for example, identifying what usage patterns correlate with the most improvement, and examining whether an index like Eval’s retention risk flag actually predicts teacher turnover. The findings will not only inform the value of Eval by SwiftScore for school districts but also contribute knowledge on how AI can be integrated into educational leadership practices to drive improvement. In sum, this research addresses a timely question at the intersection of educational effectiveness and innovation: can an AI-powered system make teacher evaluations more efficient and more impactful for teacher growth?
